A. Of the six core domains you identified, which area do you believe current AI technology is contributing to the most (or is most mature in), and conversely, which area do you think poses the most challenges (or is the most immature)?
  - 特定された「6つの領域」のうち、現状のAI技術が最も貢献している（成熟している）領域と、逆に最も課題が残る（未成熟な）領域はどれだとお考えですか？
- Is there a concern that AI might reinforce existing biases by predominantly extracting mainstream theories and research from its training data, potentially overlooking minority opinions or novel perspectives?
  - AIが学習データに含まれる既存の主流な理論や研究ばかりを抽出し、少数派の意見や新しい視点を見落としてしまう（バイアスを強化してしまう）懸念はありませんか？
- You mentioned 'adequate training for researchers' as a recommendation. Beyond just learning how to use tools like ChatGPT, what specific content regarding research ethics and the limitations of AI do you believe is essential for this training?
  - 推奨事項として「研究者への適切なトレーニング」が挙げられていました。ツール（ChatGPTなど）の操作方法だけでなく、研究倫理やAIの限界について、具体的にどのような内容のトレーニングが不可欠だとお考えですか？

1. How can we evaluate factors such as "human understanding"?
   - 人間の理解などの要素を評価するにはどうすればいいでしょうか 
2. "Will AI ever be able to solve complex problems that humans alone have been unable to solve?"
   - AIが単体で人間が解決できなかった複雑な問題を解決することはないのでしょうか
3. I believe there are examples where AI has solved complex problems that were difficult for humans alone, dramatically advancing the 'understanding' of the field itself. What are your thoughts on the potential for AI to function not merely as a 'productivity tool,' but as a catalyst that generates these kinds of genuine 'breakthroughs' and 'theoretical advancements'
4. "How can we incorporate inherently qualitative and difficult-to-evaluate factors, such as 'depth of understanding' or 'theoretical contributions,' into an objective evaluation system for hiring, promotion, and research funding allocation? Do you have any specific ideas on how this could be done?"
